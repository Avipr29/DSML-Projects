# **DSML Projects: My Data Science & Machine Learning Journey**  

Welcome to my Data Science & Machine Learning (DSML) Projects repository! 🚀

This repository serves as a chronicle of my learning journey, transitioning from SQL-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced machine learning techniques. Each project showcases my growing expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and business insights.

Project Roadmap & Progress

🔹 Foundations in Data Analysis
SQL-Based Exploratory Data Analysis – Data extraction, transformations, and trend analysis using structured query language.
Python for EDA – Leveraging Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover insights.

🔹 Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing
Descriptive Statistics & Probability – Identifying data distributions, calculating probabilities, and interpreting key statistical metrics.
Hypothesis Testing – Conducting t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to validate business hypotheses and optimize decision-making.

🔹 Predictive Modeling & Machine Learning (In Progress 🚧)
Linear & Logistic Regression – Building regression models for trend forecasting and classification problems.
Ensemble Learning – Implementing techniques like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking for performance improvements.

🔹 Upcoming Additions & Future Exploration
Unsupervised Learning – Clustering techniques like K-Means, DBSCAN, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Neural Networks & Deep Learning – Experimenting with TensorFlow/Keras to build ANN and CNN models.
Time Series Analysis – Applying forecasting techniques like ARIMA and LSTMs.
Big Data & Cloud Computing – Exploring distributed computing frameworks like Spark and deploying models on cloud platforms.

Structure & Navigation
Each project has its own dedicated repository, containing:
✔️ Project Overview – Business problem, dataset details, and objectives.
✔️ Code Notebooks – Well-documented Jupyter Notebooks or SQL queries.
✔️ Key Findings – Actionable insights from data analysis.
✔️ Tech Stack Used – Highlighting tools and technologies.

Next Steps
Expanding into unsupervised learning & deep learning concepts.
Implementing real-world case studies with industry datasets.
Enhancing visual storytelling with Tableau & Power BI dashboards.
